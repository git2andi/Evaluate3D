    Surface Analysis: This can include checking for surface continuity, detecting sharp edges, and identifying any unintended creases or folds in the model. This is particularly important for models that need to look visually appealing.

    Volume and Density: For certain applications, it might be useful to calculate the volume or the density of the model. This can be especially relevant if the model is intended for physical production or 3D printing.

    Texture and Material Analysis: If the models include texture data, assessing the quality of the textures (like resolution, mapping accuracy) and how they align with the 3D surfaces can be crucial for a good-looking model.

    Symmetry Analysis: For models that are supposed to be symmetrical, a symmetry check can be very helpful. This can include both global symmetry (the entire model) and local symmetry (specific parts of the model).

    Geometric Complexity: This can involve counting the number of polygons or vertices and evaluating the complexity of the mesh. Although you mentioned that efficiency is not a concern, having overly complex models can sometimes be a sign of inefficiencies or errors in the modeling process.

    UV Mapping Check: Evaluating the UV mapping for textures, ensuring there are no stretches or overlaps that could affect the final appearance.

    Color Analysis: If the models are colored, analyzing the color distribution and consistency can be useful, especially for models intended for visual presentations or games.
